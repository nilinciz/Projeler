    <span>his paper surveys the reduced common-mode voltage pulsewidth modulation (RCMV-PWM) methods for three-phase voltage-source inverters, investigates their performance characteristics, and provides a comparison with the standard PWM methods. PWM methods are reviewed, and their pulse patterns and common-mode voltage (CMV) patterns are illustrated. The inverter input and output current ripple characteristics and output voltage linearity characteristics of each PWM method are thoroughly investigated by analytical methods, simulations, and experiments. The research results illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of the considered methods, and suggest the utilization of the near-state PWM and active zero state PWM1 methods as overall superior methods. The paper aids in the selection and application of appropriate PWM methods in inverter drives with low CMV requirements.</span>
